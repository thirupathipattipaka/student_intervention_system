In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "\n",
    "KNN is a relatively simple algorithm that is easy to understand and intepret. it is non-parametric method and it is type of lazy learning. It doesn't take any time with good computing power to train. It can handle non-linear data and datasets with missing values also. It can give a degree of confidence in its results. KNN algorithm needs to remember the data for potential neighbords so when we are using the KNN with very large datasets it might take lot time and compting resources for prediction and it will be difficult or next to impossible to use in certain contexts. Also it is relatively less clear to choose the best K value, which could lead to bias from the user. With large datasets actually making the prediction can be costly as well as calculation of distance to many points may take lot of time.\n",

    "Decision trees are tree based supervised algorithms which are are easy to understand and usage also very easy. Distribution of data does not matter (non-parametric), and can also tolerate missing values in the features of the data. Flow charts can be used for easy visualizations and for easy interpretation. These are easy learners and prediction will be quick compare with some models and these are work well with linear and non-linear features as well as numeric and categorical input variables. Decision trees are more prone to overfitting as their learning algorithms can produce large, complicated decision trees that perfectly model every training instance but can fail to generalize the real relationship. This can be mitigated by pruning or creating a random forest. while fitting the continuous variables, we may loose some information as it need to categorize the features from continuous features into categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this student intervention problem, input features might not be linearly separable but it has many variables. Given the less time is required for data preparation in this case, decision trees may perform better and prediction in the new student also relatively easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are used in healthcare to understand the treatment patterns, patient journy and various other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines: \n",
    "The advantages of SVMs are the use of kernels, the absence of local minima, the sparseness of the solution and the capacity control obtained by optimizing the margin. By introducing the kernels, SVMs have flexibility to separate the data, either linear or nonlinear. It has a convex optimization problem, therefore more robust compared to the neutral network. SVMs are not good for large dataset, since the training time is scaled to be cubic in the size of the dataset. The required physical memory is also cubic scaled increasing along with data size in both training and testing. The performance of SVMs is highly depend on the selection of kernels and parameters such as C and gamma. It may runs very slow due to iteration and convergence problems. \n",

    "\n",
    "The SVM is very robust to very large number of variables and small samples and can learn both simple and highly complex classification models. The goal of the SVM is to train a model that assigns new unseen objects into a particular category. It achieves this by creating a linear partition of the feature space into two categories, formally defined by a separating hyperplane and will learn from data you give it on past students and whether they passed or failed, and this algorithms is trained by trying to find a linear separator between the positive test cases and the negative tests cases and the SVM try to maximize the margin width around this linear separator and the points close to the margin are the support vectors, with these vectors the SVM algorithm define the model. After the model is constructed, there is no need to store the remaining points and hence the model is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this model, based on the seperation of students in multiple dimensions, the SVM can take in data from new students and predict which side of the decision boundary they fall on, and this is how we will use it to determine whether a student is likely to pass or to fail.\n",

    "The benefit of SVMs comes from the fact that they are not restricted to being linear classifiers. Utilising this technique known as the kernel trick they can become much more flexible by introducing various types of non-linear decision boundaries. Another important benefit of the model is the use of Memory Efficiency\n",
